# Monitor Setup Utility

Setup my monitor(s) automatically (using `xrandr`) no matter what machine I'm on
or what displays are currently connected.

## Usage

```console
msu
```

This will:

* Disable all disconnected displays
* Enable the first connected display at its highest resolution
* Enable all other connected displays, at their highest resolutions, extending
  each to the right of the last
* Run the `after-setup` hook (see below)

## Hooks

If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/msu/after-setup` exists and is executable, it is executed
after the setup occurs. Use this to do things like reset wallpapers or restart
any programs sensitive to monitor sizes.

## Installation

MSU is written in Haskell and developed using Stack.

```console
stack install msu
```

## TODO

* `extend-{left,right,up,down}` - similar to default behavior, but extends in
  the direction given.
* `mirror` - works out the best way (resolution-wise) to mirror all connected
  displays then does so.
* Some method for limiting or stating explicitly which monitors are extended or
  mirrored.

## Notes

Xrandr lists your primary monitor first. MSU doesn't rely on that per-se, but it
will process them in order and you usually want the primary processed first. If
you find it doesn't do the Right Thing already, try explicitly registering one
of your displays as primary (see `man xrandr` for how).
